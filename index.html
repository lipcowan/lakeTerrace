    <h3 class="center">Lake Terrace Building Notes</h3>
    <p>The building is at the corner of 4th Avenue and 59th Street, it's about a mile from our place on 45th Street and is only two blocks from the lake.</p>
    <img src="images/frontFacade.png" class="centerImage bigImage" alt="Front of Lake Terrace Building">
    
    <p>Getting into the building should be easy...</p>
    <p>Use the black key reader on the righthand side - right of the guest services interface.</p>

    <h4>First Floor Amenities</h4>

    <img src="images/gymRoom.png" alt="wideshot of gym" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/blueBin.png" alt="blue bin outside parcel room" class="squareImage">
    <ul>
        <li>On the left when you first walk in is the community room with a pool table and TVs - they also have some outdoor seating that is pretty nice</li>
        <li>Two steps down the hall on your right (past the reception lobby for the leasing office) are the bathrooms, drinking fountain, and apartment gym (which is actually pretty nice)</li>
        <li>Further down the hallway is the mail area and the parcel room... 
            <ul>
                <li>no need to check the mail BUT...</li>
                <li>there is a big blue bin that sits there for you to use if you need to carry things up to the apartment - just make sure to return it when you're done</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Further down there is a long hallway that goes to the northside enterance and some stairs, I use that door when I'm going downtown since it's closer than going out the front</li>
        <li>FINALLY ... towards the end of the hall are two ELEVATORS!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Using the Elevator</h4>
    <p>Our apartment is on the 5th floor and you will need to use the key in the elevator</p>
    <p>You will need the key to get to any floors that have apartments ... floors 2 through 5, but you don't need to use the key first to go to the first or lowerlevel floors</p>
    <p>Hold the key to the reader and wait for it to turn green, then press the floor you want</p>

    <h4>Second Floor Amenities </h4>
    <img src="images/terraceEntrance.png" alt="second floor terrace entrance" class="portraitImage">
    <img src="images/terraceView.png" alt="view from terrace" class="portraitImage">
    <p>Stepping out on your left from the elevators you will see the entrance to the "Terrace" that gives the apartment it's namesake</p>
    <p>As of writing this they are still doing minor construction there but it's still really cool to checkout, the chairs and grill are ready but I think they're just working on lights for the evenings</p>

    <h3 class="center">Apartment 513 </h3>
    <img src="images/floorMap.png" class='centerImage bigImage' alt="map of fifth floor">
    <p>Taking the elevator up to the 5th floor... turn right out of the elevator then left down the hall and left at the end of the hall</p>
    <img src="images/arrived513.png" alt="front door of apartment 513" class="centerImage normalImage">
    <p>Unlocking the front door can be frustrating, best advice - put the fob in the center and move it around until you see the blue checkmark then hold it there until the rest of the lights turn on and you hear it unlock, takes about 3 seconds</p>

    <h4>Household Essentials</h4>
    <p>Do not feel obligated to clean but if you want to for your own comfort I've explained where to find the items needed below</p>

    <h5 class="center">Kitchen and Living Room</h5>
    <p>if you get hot or cold the thermostat is on a schedule but you can change the temperature to whatever you want</p>
    <img src="images/thermostat.png" alt="thermostat" class="smallImage">

    <p>The coat closet - the door right before the bedroom on your right - has rory's food and the vacuum (and charger for the vacuum if needed).</p>
    <img src="images/coatCloset.png" alt="coatCloset" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/vacuum.png" alt="vacuum" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/vacuumCharger.png" alt="vacuum charger cord" class="smallImage">

    <p>In the kitchen the silverware and resuable towels are in the drawer to the left of the stove and the dishes are in the cabinet above</p>
    <img src="images/silverware.png" alt="silverware drawer" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/dishes.png" alt="dishes in cabinet" class="smallImage">

    <p>At the sink the soap on the right (with the silicon bottom) is the dish soap, hand soap is on the left</p>
    <img src="images/soaps.png" alt="hand soap and dish soap comparison" class="smallImage">

    <p>Underneath the sink are some cleaning supplies, the garbage can, the dishwasher tablets, and more bags if needed</p>
    <p>If you have recycling it goes in the cardboard box by the wall next to the front door</p>
    <p>If the garbage needs to go out (again you don't have to do this but if you want to you can) in front of the building past the garge doors there are two big green bins - they're labeled on the front which is which.</p>
    <img src="images/underSink.png" alt="garbage under sink" class="smallImage">

    <p>On the fridge there is a magnet with WiFi info for you, and that page has more information and numbers for the apartment complex</p>
    <img src="images/wifiFridge.png" alt="wifi password on fridge" class="smallImage">

    <p>To the right of the stove in the drawer are cooking utensils and knives and the cabinet has the blender attachments</p>
    <img src="images/knivesAndBlender.png" alt="knives and blender in cabinet" class="smallImage">

    <p>If you get cold there are extra blankets in the chaise, just lift up the cushion, and additional blankets and bedding in the closet.</p>
    <img src="images/extraBlanketsChaise.png" alt="extra bedding in chaise" class="smallImage">
    
    <h5 class="center">Bedroom and Closet</h5>
    <p>Feel free to make youself at home and sleep in the bed if you want, sheets are fresh and clean</p>
    <p>Also in the closet on the shelf closest to the bathroom you will find towels and additional bedding if needed</p>
    <p>If you're like me when you travel you live out of your bag... but if you want you are welcome to use the closet for your clothes, sorry I don't have a dresser</p>
    <img src="images/extraBeddingCloset.png" alt="extra bedding in closet" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/towelsCloset.png" alt="towels in closet" class="smallImage">

    <p>The only wierd thing about the bedroom is... there is no light, the light on the left side of the bed is what I use BUT if you are using the outlets by the bed and for some reason they aren't working... turn on the switch by the bedroom door, it controls those outlets.</p>
    <img src="images/outletSwitch.png" alt="switch for outlets by the bed" class="smallImage">

    <h5 class="center">Bathroom Notes</h5>
    <p>Not much to put here... toilet paper is under the sink, I cleaned a little before I left</p>

    <h3 class="center">Taking care of Rory</h3>
    <img src="images/coatCloset.png" alt="coat closet" class="smallImage">
    <p>Rory eats sporatically throughout the day, I like to check in the mornings and evenings that he has at least half a cup of food in his dish... Don't worry if you forget he will probably let you know</p>
    <p>I use the plastic cup in the bag and fill it about half way so I don't overfill the dish</p>
    <p>He does drink a decent amount of water so you'll probably need to give him fresh water at least once a day</p>
    <img src="images/rorysFoodBag.png" alt="cat food bag" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/rorysFood.png" alt="cat food and water" class="smallImage">
    <p>No need to clean the catboxes unless you want to, there are two - one in the living room behind the couch and one in the bathroom - he uses both</p>
    <p>If you do decide to clean a catbox - the litter absorbs urine so all you have to do is stir the litter around and pick out the solids which you can then flush in the toilet</p>
    <img src="images/catBoxLivingRoom.png" alt="cat box in living room" class="smallImage">
    <img src="images/catBoxBathRoom.png" alt="cat box in bathroom" class="smallImage">

    <h5>Rory is very needy - be warned</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If you think you will sleep in uninterupted ... think again, Rory likes to cuddle and will poke you in the face to wake you up</li>
        <li>If you think you are going to eat uninterupted ... think again, anything that smells like milk or cheese or meat will get him begging... DO NOT GIVE IN</li>
        <li>If you think the apartment will stay nice and clean ... think again, there will be litter in the bed, on the couch, on the floor ... it kinda gets everywhere, sorry!</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>


    <h3 class="center">Emergency Numbers etc.</h3>
    <p>Call/text Iuri or Myself if it's anything Rory related... if it's something for the apartment like fire/water etc you can call the emergency services.</p>
    <p>Anything you need help with in the apartment - like if the water or power is off - there is the emergency maintenance number on the fridge.</p>
