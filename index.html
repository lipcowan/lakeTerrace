    <h3>Lake Terrace Building Notes</h3>
    <p>The building is at the corner of 4th Avenue and 59th Street, it's about a mile from our place on 45th Street and is only two blocks from the lake.</p>

    <p>Getting into the building should be easy...</p>
    <p>Use the black key reader on the righthand side - right of the guest services interface.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>On the left when you first walk in is the community room with a pool table and TVs - they also have some outdoor seating that is pretty nice</li>
        <li>Two steps down the hall on your right (past the reception lobby for the leasing office) are the bathrooms, drinking fountain, and apartment gym (which is actually pretty nice)</li>
        <li>Further down the hallway is the mail area and the parcel room... 
            <ul>
                <li>no need to check the mail BUT...</li>
                <li>there is a big blue bin that sits there for you to use if you need to carry things up to the apartment - just make sure to return it when you're done</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Further down there is a long hallway that goes to the northside enterance and some stairs, I use that door when I'm going downtown since it's closer than going out the front</li>
        <li>FINALLY ... towards the end of the hall are two ELEVATORS!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Using the Elevator</h4>
    <p>Our apartment is on the 5th floor and you will need to use the key in the elevator</p>
    <p>You will need the key to get to any floors that have apartments ... floors 2 through 5, but you don't need to use the key first to go to the first or lowerlevel floors</p>
    <p>Hold the key to the reader and wait for it to turn green, then press the floor you want</p>

    <h4>Second Floor Amenities </h4>
    <p>Stepping out on your left from the elevators you will see the entrance to the "Terrace" that gives the apartment it's namesake</p>
    <p>As of writing this they are still doing minor construction there but it's still really cool to checkout, the chairs and grill are ready but I think they're just working on lights for the evenings</p>
